# Portfolio Contact Form Email Setup

This guide will help you set up the email functionality for your portfolio contact form.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm/pnpm installed**
2. **An email account** (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, or custom SMTP)
3. **App password** (for Gmail) or SMTP credentials

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

The required dependencies should already be installed:
```bash
npm install nodemailer
npm install --save-dev @types/nodemailer
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add your email configuration:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_TO=your-email@gmail.com
```

### 3. Email Provider Settings

#### Gmail Setup
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
2. Go to [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Generate an app password for "Mail"
4. Use this app password in `EMAIL_PASS` (not your regular password)

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
```

#### Outlook/Hotmail Setup
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.live.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
```

#### Yahoo Setup
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

#### Custom SMTP
```env
EMAIL_HOST=your-smtp-server.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-username
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
```

### 4. Test the Setup

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the contact section of your portfolio
3. Fill out and submit the contact form
